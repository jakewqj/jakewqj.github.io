```Music nerd. Dumpling and sticky rice lover. A bad guitar player, a good diaper sniffer. A husband, a father. I have a cat called Lychee. ```

I started my career as an editor for one of the best-selling music instrument magazines in China, the `Modern Player Magazine` based in Beijing. 

I have become an experienced professional in music industry with a demonstrated history of working in the music and ecommerce industry for 10 years. I focus on 
- good content 
- good marketing strategies 
- promotion for Chinese indie music.

During my previous venture in e-commerce, I also established strong connections with reputable Chinese suppliers specializing in consumer electronics, lighting fixtures, and musical instruments.

I am now the PR manager at [Donner Music](https://www.donnermusic.com). Unless otherwise noted, the views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer. 

Thanks for stopping by. - Jake Wu
