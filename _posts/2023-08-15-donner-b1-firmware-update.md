[Los Angeles, August 15, 2023] – Chinese musical instrument manufacturer Donner today announced the release of the latest firmware update, V1.1.0, for the [Essential B1 Bass Synthesizer](https://www.donnermusic.com/buy/b1?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=B1FWU&utm_id=B1), their first analog bassline synthesizer with sequencer. This major update brings a host of exciting new features, enhancements, and bug fixes, making the Essential B1 even more versatile and user-friendly. 

## SONG MODE Unleashes Infinite Creativity
With the V1.1.0 firmware update and the introduction of SONG MODE, a powerful feature that extends the sequencer from 16 steps to an astounding 256 steps, users can now chain up to 16 patterns, creating seamless transitions and expanding the possibilities of music creation. The new SONG MODE can be switched automatically or manually using the 16 designated buttons, providing quick access to 16 favorite patterns. 

"SONG MODE is an outcome after the discussion and feedbacks I had with our users on Gearspace. Simply double tap the PATTERN button to enter the SONG MODE, you can program, choose, and chain up to 16 patterns from the 128 stored patterns." Says Logan Torres, product manager for the synthesizer product line of Donner, "We are deeply grateful for the valuable feedback from our users, who have continuously driven us to unlock the full potential of the Essential B1 Bass Synthesizer." 

## Other Updates from the V1.1.0
In addition to the groundbreaking SONG MODE, the V1.1.0 firmware update brings several enhancements and bug fixes, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable user experience.
- Firmware Version Display 
Upon power on, the LED screen now displays the firmware version for easy reference.
- Improved Step Editing 
The back-lit keypads now indicate the pitch of each step during REC/EDIT mode, facilitating precise adjustments.
- Streamlined Parameter Adjustment 
Adjusting OCT, GATE LENGTH, and RATCHET for each step is now faster and more intuitive by holding the corresponding button and pressing the↑/ ↓ buttons.
- Smart Save Indicator  
Whenever unsaved changes are present in the sequence, the SAVE button will light up, and when switching patterns without saving, the SAVE button will flash briefly for confirmation.
- Enhanced Random Note Generator Access
The Random Note Generator is now accessible via PLAY/STOP + REC/EDIT, simplifying the process during sequence playback.
- Improved Clear/Rest Function
To clear the pending pattern, use PLAY/STOP + CLEAR/REST instead of PATTERN + CLEAR/REST. 

To ensure the Essential B1 operates flawlessly, the V1.1.0 update also addresses some minor bugs fixes including fixes for Sequence Edit Glitch and Slide issue.
