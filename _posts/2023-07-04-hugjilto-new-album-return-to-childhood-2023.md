## About Growing up 
“Returning to Childhood” is an album about growth and the passage of time. It represents Hugjiltu's continuous musical journey, as well as his experiences at different times and stages of his life.The album has nine songs in total--six newly created by Hugjiltu and three duets with recordings of his late father (Laosier). Using music to break through the limitations of time and space, Hugjiltu reconnects the past and the present and writes a new form of story cycle.

> This album does not aim to please any specific group; it is not confined to any particular style or label. It is an album dedicated to myself and my loved ones. - Hugjilto

In addition to being responsible for the songwriting and composition of all the songs, Hugjiltu also played the morin khuur (horsehead fiddle), five-string guitar, chuur (flute), zhongruan (Chinese lute), and performed throat singing. The physical album also includes artwork created by Hugjiltu's mother, serving as illustrations within the booklet.
