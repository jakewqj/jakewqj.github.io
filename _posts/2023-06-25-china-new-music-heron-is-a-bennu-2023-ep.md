### despite the world is so big, but not a corner belongs to me
- 01 Home, Sweet Home 
> 「未曾问你来自哪里。」
关于家，关于身份，关于归属，关于灵魂的容纳之处。
"Never asked where you come from."
About home, about identity, about belonging, about the sanctuary for the soul.

- 02 Injurer 
> 「你还像从前那般？」
关于愤怒，关于立场，关于公义，关于变成曾经憎恨的人。
"Are you still the same as before?"
About anger, about stance, about justice, about becoming the person you once hated.

- 03 My Dream 
> 「昨晚睡得好吗？」
关于爱，关于记忆，关于留恋，关于每一个不眠之夜。
"Did you sleep well last night?"
About love, about memories, about longing, about every sleepless night.

- 04 Fairy Tale
> 「你启程后，不会再回来了吧。」
关于海，关于浪漫，关于自我，关于不设限的未知旅程。
"After you set off, you won't come back, will you?"
About the sea, about romance, about self, about the boundless journey of the unknown.
