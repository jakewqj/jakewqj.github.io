## tamiX's gear - Buchla 200e modular system
Buchla's modular synthesizers have possessed the creative capability of surround sound since its inception. Buchla synthesizer not only has the capacity to compose and output quadraphonic surround sound music, but it also offers the freedom to precisely control and manipulate sound positions within the quadraphonic setup. This encompassed various actions such as having notes leap, rotate, and move from distant to near within the sound field in synchronization with the rhythm. It even allowed for rotational speed adjustments to correspond with changes in pitch and timbre.
